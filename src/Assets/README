As the program starts running, the user is introduced by a introductory page about the program.
The user has two choices: Either to login, or sign up. If the user clicks the login button,
the user is directed to a login screen window where he/she can enter an email and its corresponding
password in the text fields. if the email is not found in the database or the password is incorrect,
then a display message is displayed, saying that one of the inputs is wrong. Going back, if the user prefers
to sign in, he is greeted with more text fields, such as first name, last name, birthdate, and confirm password.
After the user enters the followed information and clicks the sign up button, the information inputted will be
added to the database for accounts. The user is then directed to the feed, where the latest posts are displayed.
The user can click the 'next post' button to look at other posts found in the database and display them in the
program. The user can also type and post a comment on that post. that comment will be displayed in the program
and be stored in that post in the database. There are other buttons found in the feed controller. These are:
home button, post button, view profile button, and logout button. The home button directs the user to the feed.
The feed serves as the home page of the user. the post button directs the user to a text area where the user can
type something and post them, to be inserted in the post database. The view profile button shows the personal
information of the account used to log in. Finally, the logout button brings the user to a window, asking if
he/she would want to logout the account. if the user clicked yes, the user will be brought back to the login
window. As a last note, all the account information and personal information can be accessed an manipulated
in the remotemysql.com site.
