# LBYCPD2_Project
This is a project requirement for LBYCPC2.

Introduction
The farmer's disease control software is a JavaFX-based program that aims to help 
farmers protect their crops and livestock from infectious diseases.
This is done by picturing these sick plants or animals and posting them through
the software. That way, farmers who are within the province where
the post is published take necessary precautions to protect their crops and livestock.

As a requirement, this project must be software-based. Other requirements 
include external databases, functionality, and real-life application.

The project runs using JavaFX, to include the graphic interface. In addition, 
CSS is also used to give color and design to every scene of the program. 
To run the software, run the program using the Main.java application. 
A window pops up showing the main page. This page is where the goal of 
the software is displayed. This is to help promote the software and persuade 
users, especially farmers, to use the software. As of now, there are two 
functions already implemented into the program. These are the login and 
sign-up features. To login into the software, click the login word on the 
top-right corner of the main page. Clicking the word will change the scene 
from the main page scene to the login scene. Afterward, a text field and a 
password field appear on the login page. The user must then input the email 
and password of that email. Once the user presses the login button, the software 
checks the accounts database to check if the email and password entered by the 
user are in the database. If the login credentials are correct, the login scene 
will change back to the main page scene. This transition is temporary and will 
be changed shortly. If the credentials are wrong. An error message will pop up,
telling the user that the email or password is incorrect. The next feature is the 
sign-up feature. Unlike the login feature, the sign-up feature help users create 
a new account. A user can create a new email and password by typing them into the 
text fields. Once a user signs up, the details will be added to the accounts database.
